== TODO

* Back link on TV show page in order to return to search results
* Delete post event to trigger alert to make sure if user wants to delete
* Display text if pages (profile) have nothing there
* Delete shows from watchlist
* Set a 2 sec timeout to Follow button with placeholder text (ex. Following...) before switching over to Following status because feels too abrupt
* When post deleted & user unfollowed, fade in flash message that acknowledges successful deletion
* Read More for long blurbs in search results (http://jquery-plugins.net/readmore-js-jquery-plugin-to-expand-and-collapse-texts)
* Clean up render functions in views with subviews by pulling subview rendering into separate function
* Center post deletes vertically
* Get search url to be "#/search" instead of without slash


== REACH TODOS

* TV show pages to display live stream of comments about show
* User feeds
